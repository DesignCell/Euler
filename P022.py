# Problem 22
# Names Score

# Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a
# 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names, begin
# by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the
# alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its
# alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.

# For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order,
# COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th
# name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.

# What is the total of all the name scores in the file?

# save file to list
file_path = r'Python\ProjectEuler\P022_names.txt' #Path relative to working folder _Programming
names = open(file_path, 'r')
name_list = names.read()
names.close

# clean up list: split by ',' and remove quotes, then sort
name_list = name_list.replace('"','')
name_list = name_list.split(',')
name_list.sort()

# function to determin name score from alpha place sum
